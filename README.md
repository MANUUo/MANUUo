## 👋 Hi there, I'm Manu

🎓 I'm a Systems Engineering student passionate about backend development, automata theory, and clean code architecture.

💻 I work mostly with **Java**, **Python**, **JavaScript**, and **Node.js**.  
📚 Always learning — currently diving deeper into **OOP**, **automata**, and **graph-based visualizations**.

🚀 I enjoy building projects that combine theory and practice, from interpreters and AFDs to web apps and visual tools.

📫 Feel free to reach out or check out my repositories to see what I'm working on!
